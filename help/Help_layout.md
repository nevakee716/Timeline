## Steps

Describe your step in a json file, then mimify it on https://www.cleancss.com/json-minify/
Here is an exemple : 

```
{
    "application_roadmap_per_type": {    // node ID
        "step1": {                       //id of the step must be unique
            "name": "step1",             // name of the step
            "start": "WHENCREATED",      // property scriptname of the start date
            "end": "GOLIVEDATE",         // property scriptname of the end date,  
                                         // will be set to current if the date is not set
            "style": "color: green; background-color: orange;"    // css style of the step
        },
        "step2": {
            "name": "step2",
            "start": "GOLIVEDATE",
            "end": "ENDDATE",
            "style": "color: yellow; background-color: blue;"
        }
    },
    "application_20020_230578405": {
        "step3": {
            "name": "step3",
            "start": "WHENCREATED",
            "end": "WHENUPDATED",
            "style": "color: red; background-color: pink;"
        }
    }
}

```
If you don't put "end" in your step, the time entry will be display as a point
